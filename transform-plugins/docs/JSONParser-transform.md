# JSON Parser Transform

## Description

Parses an input JSON event into a record. The input JSON event could be either a map of
string fields to values or it could be a complex nested JSON structure. The plugin allows you
to express JSON paths for extracting fields from complex nested input JSON.

## Parsing Simple JSON

Simple JSON (which is defined as a mapping from key to value) parsing is achieved
by specifying just the output schema fields. The field name in the output schema
should be the same as the key in the input JSON. The type of the output field should also be the
same type as the input value. No implicit conversions are performed on the JSON values.

Here is an example of an event that is to be mapped to the output schema:

    {
       "id" : 1000,
       "first" : "Joltie",
       "last" : "Neutrino",
       "email_id" : "joltie.neutrino@gmail.com",
       "address" : "666 Mars Street",
       "city" : "Marshfield",
       "state" : "MR",
       "country" : "Marshyland",
       "zip" : 34553423,
       "planet" : "Earth"
    }


The output schema should be specified as:

    +==========================+
    | Field    | Type   | Null |
    |----------|--------|------|
    | id       | int    |      |
    | first    | string |      |
    | last     | string |      |
    | email_id | string |      |
    | address  | string |      |
    | city     | string |      |
    | state    | string |      |
    | country  | string |      |
    | zip      | long   |      |
    +==========================+

**Note:** The field "planet" has not been included in the output schema, meaning that the
field would be ignored and not processed when the JSON event is mapped. 

## Parsing Nested JSON

Parser also allows the extracting of fields from a complex nested JSON. In order to extract
fields, it uses JSON paths similar to the XPath expressions for XML. To extract fields using an
expression in JSON, this plugin uses the 'JsonPath' library. The plugin allows you to define a
mapping from the output fieldname to the JSON path expression that is to be applied on input to
extract the value from the JSON event. For example, if you have this nested JSON:

    {
      "employee" : {
        "name" : {
          "first" : "Joltie",
          "last" : "Neutrino"
        },
        "email" : "joltie.neutrino@gmail.com",
        "address" :  {
          "street1" : "666, Mars Street",
          "street2" : "",
          "apt" : "",
          "city" : "Marshfield",
          "state" : "MR",
          "zip" : 34553423,
          "country" : "Marshyland"
        }
      }
    }


You could specify the mapping for extracting these fields from the input JSON event as:
 
  1. first
  2. last
  3. email
  4. street1
  5. city
  6. state
  7. zip
  8. country

The mappings in the plugin will be:

    +================================================+
    | Output Field Name | Input JSON Path Expression |
    |-------------------|----------------------------|
    | first             | $.employee.name.first      |
    | last              | $.employee.name.last       |
    | email             | $.employee.email           |
    | street            | $.employee.address.street1 |
    | city              | $.employee.address.city    |
    | state             | $.employee.address.state   |
    | zip               | $.employee.address.zip     |
    | country           | $.employee.address.country |
    +================================================+

### Expression

The "root member object" for parsing any JSON is referred to as ```$```, regardless of
whether it's an array or an object. It also uses either dot notation or bracket notation for
defining the levels of parsing. For example: ```$.employee.name``` or ```$[employee][name]```.

#### Supported Operators

These operators are supported:

    +========================================================================+
    | Operator          | Description                                        |
    |-------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
    | $                 | The root element of the query                      |
    | *                 | Wildcard                                           |
    | ..                | Deep scan                                          |
    | .<name>           | Dot notation representing child                    |
    | [?(<expression>)] | Filter expression, should be boolean result always |
    +========================================================================+

#### Supported Functions

The functions perform aggregations at the tail end of the path. The functions take the
output of the expression as input for performing aggregations. The aggregation function
can be only be applied where the expression results in an array. 

    +==================================================================+ 
    | Function | Type   | Description                                  |
    |----------|--------|----------------------------------------------|
    | min      | double | Minimum value of array of numbers            |
    | max      | double | Maximum value of array of numbers            |
    | avg      | double | Average value of array of numbers            |
    | stddev   | double | Standard deviation value of array of numbers |
    | length   | int    | Length of the array                          |
    +==================================================================+
