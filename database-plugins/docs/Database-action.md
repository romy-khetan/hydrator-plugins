# Database Action


Description
-----------
Action that runs a database command.


Use Case
--------
The action can be used whenever you want to run a database command before or after a data pipeline.
For example, you may want to run a sql update command on a database before the pipeline source pulls data from tables.


Properties
----------
**query:** The database command to execute.

**connectionString:** JDBC connection string including database name.

**user:** User identity for connecting to the specified database. Required for databases that need
authentication. Optional for databases that do not require authentication.

**password:** Password to use to connect to the specified database. Required for databases
that need authentication. Optional for databases that do not require authentication.

**jdbcPluginName:** Name of the JDBC plugin to use. This is the value of the 'name' key
defined in the JSON file for the JDBC plugin.

**jdbcPluginType:** Type of the JDBC plugin to use. This is the value of the 'type' key
defined in the JSON file for the JDBC plugin. Defaults to 'jdbc'.

**enableAutoCommit:** Whether to enable auto-commit for queries run by this source. Defaults to 'false'.
Normally this setting does not matter. It only matters if you are using a jdbc driver -- like the Hive
driver -- that will error when the commit operation is run, or a driver that will error when auto-commit is
set to false. For drivers like those, you will need to set this to 'true'.


Example
-------
This example connects to a database using the specified 'connectionString', which means
it will connect to the 'prod' database of a PostgreSQL instance running on 'localhost'.
It will run an update command to set the price of record with ID 6 to 20.
